Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pipchu/sales-2020-2021

The dataset (sales_06_FY2020-21)contains sales transaction data for the fiscal year 22020â€“2021. the dataset is quite extensive, with 286,392 entries and 36 columns. Here is a brief overview of the key columns and the data they represent:

order_id: Unique identifier for each order.

order_date: Date when the order was placed.

status: status of the order.

item_id: A unique identifier for each item in the order.

sku: stock-keeping unit, a unique identifier for the product.

qty_ordered: quantity of the item ordered.

price: price per unit of the item.

value: the total value of the item in the order (quantity * price).

discount_amount: Discount applied to the item.

total: the final total for the item after discounts.

category: category of the product.

payment_method: Payment method used for the order.

bi_st: Possibly billing state or a similar identifier.

cust_id: A unique identifier for the customer.

year: year of the transaction.

month: month of the transaction.

full_name: Full name of the customer.

Gender: gender of the customer.

age: age of the customer.

E Mail: Email address of the customer.

SSN: Social Security Number of the customer.

Phone No.: The phone number of the customer.

Place Name: The location name associated with the customer.

County: county associated with the customer.

City: City associated with the customer.

State: State associated with the customer.

Zip: ZIP code associated with the customer.

Region: Region associated with the customer.

User Name: Username of the customer.

Discount_Percent: Percentage of discount applied.

Summary of the Data:

Data Type: The dataset includes a mix of numeric and categorical variables, with some columns (like order_id, sku, and bi_st) being of object (string) type, while others (like price, quantity_ordered, and age) are numeric.

Size: The dataset is large, containing 286,392 rows, which will provide a robust base for any analysis.

As expected, Mobiles & Tablets are the highest sold category in Texas, with male customers slightly outnumbering females; however, it's beneficial to concentrate on both demographics and expand focus to different categories such as School & Education products, Books, and Soghaat to diversify sales.

```{r}

# Add a categorization column based on customer_since
sales_data <- Sales_2021 %>%
  mutate(customer_group = ifelse(customer_since < 2000, "Before 2000", "2000 and After"))

# Calculate average price_after_discount for each group
average_prices <- sales_data %>%
  group_by(customer_group) %>%
  summarize(average_price_after_discount = mean(price_after_discount), .groups = 'drop')

# Output the results
print(average_prices)

# Create a bar chart to visualize average prices

Nearly 50 % of the orders are refunds and cancellations, To decrease refunds and cancellations, we should focus on improving product quality, enhancing customer support, providing clear product descriptions, implementing flexible return policies, gathering customer feedback, sending pre-order confirmations, optimizing delivery experiences, improving the user experience are to be done.

In May, June, and July, people tend to buy more.

Modelling:    


we're building a logistic regression model to predict whether an order will be a "Refund or Cancellation" based on factors like price, discount, category, payment type, and more. After creating the model, we calculate the predicted probabilities for each order, showing how likely it is to be refunded or canceled. Finally, we plot these probabilities against the price to see how the price affects the likelihood of a refund or cancellation.

We're finding how different factors, especially the price, influence the chances of an order being refunded or canceled.

<font size = "5" color = "blue"> Modeling </font>

```{r}


# Convert 'status' to a binary factor
Sales_2021$status_binary <- ifelse(Sales_2021$status == "Refund or Cancellation", 1, 0)

# Logistic regression model to predict order status
model <- glm(status_binary ~ price + discount_amount + category + payment_type + month + year + age + region, 
             data = Sales_2021, 
             family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)

# Add predicted probabilities to the data frame
Sales_2021$predicted_probabilities <- predict(model, type = "response")
head(Sales_2021, 20)


# Plot the predicted probabilities against one of the predictors, e.g., price
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Sales_2021, aes(x = price, y = predicted_probabilities)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE) + #Adds the regression line to the plot
  labs(title = "Predicted Probability of Refund or Cancellation vs. Price",
       x = "Price",
       y = "Predicted Probability of Refund or Cancellation")
```

Potential Insights:

Refund/Cancellation Sensitivity:
There is a strong correlation between price and the likelihood of a refund or cancellation, with higher prices leading to a greater chance of these outcomes.
